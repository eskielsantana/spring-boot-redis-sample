# Eskiel`s Redis+Springboot sample
This is just a simple sample I am doing to study Redis behavior

To run the project and use all his features (Person crud) you must have a Redis server running in your computer.

Even being so simple, this is a functional project and I plan to use it whenever I need to manage a Redis project.

The more I learn about redis, the more I'm going to improve this project... (The same is valid to all other repositories I have and its respective technologies)
